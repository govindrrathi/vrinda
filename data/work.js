The sun represents the source of all life, so we start with this project as the source of other paintings. To complete this project, I learned and applied all the basic skills of Madhubani including kachni (line work), bharni (painting), and other simple patterns.",

Within Hindu culture, peacocks are associated with the well-known god Krishna, who is often shown wearing peacock feathers in his hair.

These animals have been decorated and used in Hindu festivals since ancient times, which is why the painting also shows a well-decorated elephant. Once again, I continued to learn how to use color combinations and patterns to create a painting that was visually appealing.",

In Hindu and Buddhist cultures, these geometric patterns are used as tools for meditation and they represent the universe. This specific mandala shows the different forms of life on our planet, ranging from the swimming fish to the flying birds to the plants on the ground. I used all three of the secondary colors because they complemented each other and provided a range of colors for me to work with.",

Ganesha has the head of an elephant and is known as the ‘remover of obstacles’ and ‘lord of beginnings’, so we pray to him for prosperity and fortune. To create this piece, I found an image of a statue of Ganesha and then converted it to a 2-dimensional painting so I could create it on a canvas.",

The first 9 have descended upon Earth at some time, but the tenth one is yet to come and will descend at the end of our current era, Kali Yug, to defeat evil.

After the big war, Ram & Sita decided to reward everyone who helped them win. Sita gave Hanuman her priceless pearl necklace, but he began to break the pearls. When Ram asked him why he did that, Hanuman said that he does not wear anything that doesn’t have Ram’s name. Ram’s brother, Lakshman, laughed and asked him why he keeps his body alive then, because his body can’t have Ram’s name. Hanuman then tore open his chest to show that even his body had Ram in it and from that day on, no one ever doubted his loyalty and he is known as one of Lord Rama’s biggest devotees.",
