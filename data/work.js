The sun represents the source of all life, so we start with this project as the source of other paintings. To complete this project, I learned and applied all the basic skills of Madhubani including kachni (line work), bharni (painting), and other simple patterns.",

Within Hindu culture, peacocks are associated with the well-known god Krishna, who is often shown wearing peacock feathers in his hair. I chose an image of a peacock to use as a reference and learned how to use different colors and patterns that looked nice together.",

These animals have been decorated and used in Hindu festivals since ancient times, which is why the painting also shows a well-decorated elephant. Once again, I continued to learn how to use color combinations and patterns to create a painting that was visually appealing.",

In Hindu and Buddhist cultures, these geometric patterns are used as tools for meditation and they represent the universe. This specific mandala shows the different forms of life on our planet, ranging from the swimming fish to the flying birds to the plants on the ground. I used all three of the secondary colors because they complemented each other and provided a range of colors for me to work with.",

I learned how to draw humans for the first time and chose to draw a lady collecting water from a lake, carrying her pot on her head.

This piece shows their wedding, with Krishna holding his famous flute and Radha placing a garland around his neck. In the background, I added peacocks because they are associated with Krishna and his peacock feather that he wears on his head.",

Ganesha has the head of an elephant and is known as the ‘remover of obstacles’ and ‘lord of beginnings’, so we pray to him for prosperity and fortune. To create this piece, I found an image of a statue of Ganesha and then converted it to a 2-dimensional painting so I could create it on a canvas.",

To make the painting as realistic as possible, I showed all the women using traditional methods of cooking and added a well in the background. Throughout this painting, I continued to practice drawing humans and learned some new techniques used in the tree and background.",

According to Buddhism, which was founded by Buddha, there are 7 main chakras that work together to create balance and peace in your body. These chakras are shown near their associated body parts in my painting. ",
