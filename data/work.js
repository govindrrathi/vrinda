The sun represents the source of all life, so we start with this project as the source of other paintings. To complete this project, I learned and applied all the basic skills of Madhubani including kachni (line work), bharni (painting), and other simple patterns.",

To complete this project, I learned some more skills like the water lines, fish scales, and shells, while practicing kachni, bharni, and other basic patterns again.",

Within Hindu culture, peacocks are associated with the well-known god Krishna, who is often shown wearing peacock feathers in his hair. I chose an image of a peacock to use as a reference and learned how to use different colors and patterns that looked nice together.",

These animals have been decorated and used in Hindu festivals since ancient times, which is why the painting also shows a well-decorated elephant. Once again, I continued to learn how to use color combinations and patterns to create a painting that was visually appealing.",

In Hindu and Buddhist cultures, these geometric patterns are used as tools for meditation and they represent the universe. This specific mandala shows the different forms of life on our planet, ranging from the swimming fish to the flying birds to the plants on the ground. I used all three of the secondary colors because they complemented each other and provided a range of colors for me to work with.",
